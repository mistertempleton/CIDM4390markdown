<p>CIDM 4390 – Software Systems Development serves as the capstone software development class for the Computer Information Systems undergraduate program in the College of Business at West Texas A&amp;M University. During the Spring 2019 semester, the focus of the class was on providing value to the Panhandle Regional Planning Commission (PRPC) by way of improving their online services, so that interested parties would be able to access timely and relevant information regarding public transportation online.</p>
<p>This work was undertaken through the use of the widely-adopted software development framework known as <a href="#https://www.scrum.org/">SCRUM</a>. This framework places exceptionally high value on <strong>transparency</strong>, <strong>adaptation</strong>, and <strong>inspection</strong>, and these tenants are viewed as being absolutely integral to properly implementing SCRUM.</p>
<p>Adherence to these foundational tenants was realized in the following ways:</p>
<p><strong>Inspection</strong>: The ability to inspect the work being done by the other members of the development team is absolutely crucial to success. During the course of the semester this was largely observed by ensuring that the development work being done was regularly checked in via gia commits, and through adherence to a decidedly rigorous daily “stand-up” meeting schedule throughout the semester.</p>
<p><strong>Adaptation</strong>: The work of software development can be a decidedly messy endeavor, and this semester was certainly no exception. Things changed, and changed frequently. Most often this change took the shape of curtailing expectations with regards to sprint goals based on whether they could be realistically be accomplished during the current sprint, so as to allow us to better focus on, and ultimately deliver, the most value for the involved stakeholders.</p>
<p><strong>Transparency</strong>: Within the context of SCRUM, this generally takes the form of what might be called ‘organizational honesty’. In that those involved in the project are honest with other involved parties. Within the context of Software Systems Development however, this more took the form of honest communication between team members about realistic expectations, and very much ties back into the previous tenant.</p>
<h1 id="diagrams-1"><a href="#diagrams">Diagrams</a></h1>
<p>Several diagrams were drawn up at the start of development, during the inital <strong>sprint</strong>, and are again laid out here for the sake of posterity:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/dgXIlnz.png" alt="Class Diagram"><br>
This class diagram attempts to illustrate how the various disparate sections of the product (ideally) interact, their various attributes, and their <strong>methods</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/DtwputC.png" alt="Use Cases"> The above diagram is a demonstration of <strong>use cases</strong>, which are attempts to both conceptualize and formulize how an end-user interacts with a given system by focusing on what the expected end result of using said system is, as opposed to (for example) how said systems’ user interface appears.<br>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/TI5cOpb.png" alt="PRPC ERD"> This Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) demonstrates how various entities relate to one another, and their properties, within the context of being utilized in a <strong>database context</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/aasrsdM.png" alt="Sequence1"> This <strong>sequence diagram</strong> demonstrates how a user would interact with the system by way of diagramming the the sequential steps that would occur during said interaction.

<h1 id="glossary-1"><a href="#glossary">Glossary</a></h1>
<p>Here are a selection of the most commonly employed terms when considering the use of the SCRUM framework, taken from <em>Essential Scrum: A Practical Guide to the Most Popular Agile Process</em> 1st ed. by Kenneth S. Rubin:</p>
<p><strong>acceptance criteria</strong>: 1. The external quality characteristics specified by the product owner from a business or stakeholder perspective. Acceptance criteria define desired behavior and are used to determine whether a product backlog item has been successfully developed. 2. The exit criteria that a component or a system must satisfy in order to be accepted by a user, customer, or other authorized entity.</p>
<p><strong>adaptation</strong>: One of the three pillars of empirical process control; feedback is used to make an adjustment to the work product being developed or the process by which it is being developed.</p>
<p><strong>agile</strong>: 1. A specific set of values and principles, as expressed in the Agile Manifesto (Beck et al. 2001). 2. An umbrella term used for a group of related approaches to software development based on iterative and incremental development. Scrum is an agile approach to development.</p>
<p><strong>artifact</strong>: A tangible by-product produced during product development. The product backlog, sprint backlog, and potentially shippable product increment are examples of Scrum artifacts. See also practice.</p>
<p><strong>burndown chart</strong>: A graph that shows on the vertical axis the quantity of work (in either hours or product backlog item units) remaining over time, which is shown on the horizontal axis. Because less and less work should remain over time, the general trend in the graph is to burn down to a point where no work remains. We can show projected outcomes on burndown charts by calculating a trend line to see when work might be completed.</p>
<p><strong>burnup chart</strong>: A graph that shows the progress of work toward a goal line associated with a value on the vertical axis. As work is completed over time (the horizontal axis), the progress line moves up (burns up) to be nearer to the goal line. We can show projected outcomes on burnup charts by calculating a trend line to see when work might be completed.</p>
<p><strong>ceremony</strong>: A ritualistic or symbolic activity that is performed on well-defined occasions. Some people refer to the core Scrum activities of sprint planning, daily scrum, sprint review, and sprint retrospective as ceremonies.</p>
<p><strong>chief product owner</strong>: The overall product owner within a product owner team on a large development effort.</p>
<p><strong>conditions of satisfaction</strong>: The conditions under which a product owner would be satisfied that a product backlog item is done. Conditions of satisfaction are acceptance criteria that clarify the desired behavior.</p>
<p><strong>continuous deployment</strong> / <strong>continuous delivery</strong>: Deploying each new feature to users immediately after it is built, integrated, and tested.</p>
<p><strong>continuous integration</strong>: A technical practice where members of a single team or multiple teams integrate their work as frequently as is practical.</p>
<p><strong>daily scrum</strong>: A synchronization, inspection, and adaptive planning activity that a development team performs each day. This core practice in the Scrum framework is timeboxed to no more than 15 minutes.</p>
<p><strong>daily stand-up</strong>: A common approach to performing a daily scrum whereby the participants stand for the entirety of the activity. Standing up promotes brevity and helps ensure that the activity does not exceed its timebox.</p>
<p><strong>definition of done</strong>: 1. A checklist of the types of work that the team is expected to successfully complete by the end of the sprint, before it can declare its work to be potentially shippable. A bare-minimum definition of done should yield a complete slice of product functionality, one that has been designed, built, integrated, tested, and documented and will deliver validated customer value. 2. Sometimes described as the acceptance criteria that apply to all product backlog items.</p>
<p><strong>development team</strong>: A self-organizing, cross-functional team of people who collectively are responsible for all of the work necessary to produce working, validated assets. One of the three roles that constitute every Scrum team.</p>
<p><strong>feature</strong>: 1. A slice of business functionality that is meaningful to a customer or user. 2. Used by some to mean a medium-size user story that can and will be divided into a collection of smaller user stories that together will be implemented to deliver the value of a feature.</p>
<p><strong>inspection</strong>: One of the three pillars of empirical process control, involving thoughtful examination and processing of feedback to make adaptation decisions regarding the process or product.</p>
<p><strong>iteration</strong>: A self-contained development cycle focused on performing all of the work necessary to produce a valuable outcome.</p>
<p><strong>minimum viable product</strong>: (MVP). A product that has just those features that allow the product to be deployed, and no more.</p>
<p><strong>must-have features</strong>:. The set of features that must be present in the upcoming release for the release to be viable.</p>
<p><strong>nonfunctional requirement</strong>: 1. A requirement that does not relate to functionality but to attributes such as reliability, efficiency, usability, maintainability, and portability, which product backlog items must possess in order to be fully accepted by the stakeholders. 2. Each nonfunctional requirement is a candidate for inclusion in the definition of done.</p>
<p><strong>Planning Poker</strong>: A consensus-based technique for the relative sizing of product backlog items.</p>
<p><strong>product</strong>: 1. The result of a product development effort. 2. A good or service consisting of a bundle of tangible and intangible attributes that satisfies consumers and is received in exchange for money or some other unit of value. 3. Typically a longerlived, more stable artifact against which organizations might conduct one or more projects.</p>
<p><strong>product backlog</strong>: A prioritized inventory of yet-to-be-worked-on product backlog items. See also product backlog item.</p>
<p><strong>product backlog item (PBI)</strong>: 1. An item such as a feature, defect, or (occasionally) technical work that is valuable from the product owner’s perspective. 2. An item in the product backlog.</p>
<p><strong>product owner</strong>: The empowered central point of product leadership. One of the three roles on a Scrum team; the single voice of the stakeholder community to the Scrum team. The product owner defines what to do and in what order to do it.</p>
<p><strong>refactoring</strong>: A technique for restructuring an existing body of code by improving/ simplifying its internal structure (design) without changing its external behavior. Refactoring is one of the principal techniques for managing technical debt.</p>
<p><strong>release</strong>: 1. A combination of features that when packaged together make for a coherent deliverable to customers or users. 2. A version of a product that is promoted for use or deployment. Releases represent the rhythm of business-value delivery and should align with defined business cycles.</p>
<p><strong>role</strong>: A cohesive set of responsibilities that may be fulfilled by one or more people. The three Scrum roles are product owner, ScrumMaster, and development team.</p>
<p><strong>Scrum</strong>: A term borrowed from the sport of rugby. 1. A lightweight agile framework for managing complex product and service development. 2. An iterative and incremental approach to developing products and managing work.</p>
<p><strong>Scrum framework</strong>: A collection of values, principles, practices, and rules that form the foundation of Scrum-based development.</p>
<p><strong>ScrumMaster</strong>: The coach, facilitator, impediment remover, and servant leader of the Scrum team. The ScrumMaster is one of the three roles on a Scrum team. The ScrumMaster provides process leadership and helps the Scrum team and the rest of the organization develop their own high-performance, organization-specific Scrum approach.</p>
<p><strong>Scrum team</strong>: A team composed of a product owner, ScrumMaster, and development team that works on a Scrum development effort.</p>
<p><strong>self-organization</strong>: 1. A bottom-up emergent property of a complex adaptive system whereby the organization of the system emerges over time as a response to its environment. 2. A property of a development team that organizes itself over time, without an external dominating force applying traditional top-down, command-and-control management. 3. Reflects the management philosophy whereby operational decisions are delegated as much as possible to those who have the most detailed knowledge of the consequences and practicalities associated with those decisions.</p>
<p><strong>servant leader</strong>: 1. A person who achieves results for her organization by giving priority attention to the needs of her colleagues and those she serves. 2. A philosophy and practice of leadership based on listening, empathy, healing, awareness, persuasion, conceptualization, foresight, stewardship, commitment, and community building.</p>
<p><strong>sprint</strong>: A short-duration, timeboxed iteration. Typically a timebox between one week and a calendar month during which the Scrum team is focused on producing a potentially shippable product increment that meets the Scrum team’s agreed-upon definition of done.</p>
<p><strong>sprint backlog</strong>: 1. An artifact produced at a sprint-planning meeting and continuously updated during sprint execution that helps a self-organizing team better plan and manage the work necessary to deliver on the sprint goal. 2. A list of the product backlog items pulled into a sprint and an associated plan for how to achieve them— frequently expressed in terms of tasks that are estimated in ideal hours.</p>
<p><strong>sprint demo</strong>: 1. An activity of a sprint review where the completed (done) product backlog items are demonstrated with the goal of promoting an information-rich discussion between the Scrum team and other sprint review participants. 2. A term that is frequently used synonymously to refer to the entire sprint review. See also sprint review.</p>
<p><strong>sprint goal</strong>: A high-level summary of the goal the product owner would like to accomplish during the sprint. Frequently elaborated through a specific set of product backlog items.</p>
<p><strong>sprint planning</strong>: A time when the Scrum team gathers to agree on a sprint goal and determine what subset of the product backlog it can deliver during the forthcoming sprint. During sprint planning, a sprint backlog is produced to help the team acquire confidence that it can deliver the committed product backlog items.</p>
<p><strong>sprint retrospective</strong>: An inspect-and-adapt activity performed at the end of every sprint. The sprint retrospective is a continuous improvement opportunity for a Scrum team to review its process (approaches to performing Scrum) and to identify opportunities to improve it.</p>
<p><strong>sprint review</strong>: An inspect-and-adapt activity that occurs after sprint execution where the Scrum team shows to all interested parties what was accomplished during the sprint. The sprint review gives everyone with input in the product development effort an opportunity to inspect what has been built so far and adapt what will be built next.</p>
<p><strong>stakeholder</strong>: A person, group, or organization that affects or can be affected by an organization’s actions.</p>
<p><strong>stakeholder value</strong>: The value that a solution delivers to stakeholders. Sometimes used interchangeably with customer value.</p>
<p><strong>story point</strong>: A measure of the relative size of product backlog items that takes into account factors such as complexity and physical size. Typically determined by engaging in Planning Poker.</p>
<p><strong>task</strong>: The technical work that a development team performs in order to complete a product backlog item. Most tasks are defined to be small, representing no more than a few hours to a day or so of work.</p>
<p><strong>technical debt</strong>: 1. A term used to describe the obligation that a software organization incurs when it chooses a design or construction approach that is expedient in the short term but that increases complexity and is more costly in the long term. 2. A metaphor that facilitates the communication between business and technical people regarding implementation artifact inadequacies.</p>
<p><strong>test-driven development (TDD)</strong>: 1. An evolutionary approach to development based on writing a failing automated test before the functional code that makes the test pass. Once the code is written to pass the test, the cycle is then repeated, including refactoring the existing code to ensure a coherent cross-functional design. The goal of test-driven development is specification and not validation—to think through a design before code is written, to create clean code that always works. 2. An example of test-first development.</p>
<p><strong>test-first development</strong>: A technical practice where the tests are written before the development is performed. An example is test-driven development.</p>
<p><strong>timebox</strong>: A fixed-length period of time during which an activity is performed. In Scrum, sprints are timeboxed iterations where a team works at a sustainable pace to complete a chosen, WIP-limited set of work.</p>
<p><strong>timeboxing</strong>: A time management technique that helps organize the performance of work and manage scope.</p>
<p><strong>transparency</strong>: One of the three pillars of empirical process control; open access to the unbiased information required for inspection and adaptation.</p>
<p><strong>user story</strong>: A convenient format for expressing the desired business value for many types of product backlog items. User stories are crafted in a way that makes them understandable for both business people and technical people. They are structurally simple and typically expressed in a format such as “As a I want to achieve so that I get .” They provide a great placeholder for a conversation. Additionally, they can be written at various levels of granularity and are easy to progressively refine.</p>
<h1 id="iterations-1"><a href="#iterations">Iterations</a></h1>
<p>As previously discussed, the work undertaken during a SCRUM project is sub-divided into iterations known as ‘sprints’. The sprints undertaken by Team Spartan during the Spring 2019 semester are detailed herein:</p>
<h1 id="sprint-1-220---38"><a href="#sprint1">Sprint 1</a> (2/20 - 3/8)</h1>
<p>Sprint 1 was timeboxed from February 20th through March 8th, 2019. This sprint largely served as an introduction to the mechanics of active development via the SCRUM process, and was viewed more like a “Sprint 0.5” than a full sprint.</p>
<p>The sprint focused on the development of several features:</p>
<p>– The ability for a new user to register for full access to the application</p>
<p>– The ability for a registered user to change their password.</p>
<p>– The ability to view bus routes.</p>
<p>As was the case with all five sprints during the semester, the features under development were formalized through the use of both user stories and acceptance criteria, which are detailed below, along with the associated number of story points associated with each task under consideration:</p>
<p><em>User Story – New User</em> (5 story points)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As an unregistered user<br>
I want be able to register for an account<br>
So that I can login</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Acceptance Criteria – New User</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Given I am unregistered, and I am a valid local resident<br>
When I attempt to register for an account<br>
Then website should send a confirmation email</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>User Story – Change Password</em> (2 story points)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As registered user<br>
I want recover my password<br>
So that I can change it</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Acceptance Criteria – Change Password</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Given user is at the login screen<br>
When they click forgot password button<br>
Then are redirected to change password</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>User Story – Bus Routes</em> (2 story points)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a registered user<br>
I want to login<br>
So that I can look at route times of buses</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Acceptance Criteria – Bus Routes</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Given I am a registered user and I am logged in<br>
When I go to the bus schedule<br>
Then I will be able view route times</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In hindsight, these sprint goals were decidedly modest relative to those undertaken during the rest of the course of the semester, but certainly served as an appropriate introduction into the intricacies of active SCRUM development, without a doubt.</p>
<h1 id="sprint-2-38---320"><a href="#sprint2">Sprint 2</a> (3/8 - 3/20)</h1>
<p>Sprint 2 was timeboxed from March 8th through March 20th, 2019. This sprint, in hindsight, largely served as both a continuation of active development from sprint 1, and also introduced a few new features under active development, whose user stories and acceptance criteria are detailed below:</p>
<p><em>User Story – Canyon Route Map</em> (8 story points)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a user<br>
I want to view the Canyon route map<br>
so I can select a route</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Acceptance Criteria – Canyon Route Map</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Given I am a user<br>
When I select the Canyon maps and it displays those routes<br>
Then I can select a route</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="sprint-3-320---43"><a href="#sprint3">Sprint 3</a> (3/20 - 4/3)</h1>
<p>Sprint 3 was timeboxed from March 20th through April 3rd, 2019. The main focus in terms of development of new features was the integration of SMS notifications upon account creation and verification. In this case, Twilio was used for this purpose. The associated user story and acceptance criteria are below:</p>
<p><em>User Story - SMS Notifications</em> (3 Story Points)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a user<br>
I want to receive an SMS when my ride is purchased, my ride is about to pick me up, or if it is delayed<br>
So I can be ready to see the transaction was completed, I can be outside to meet the bus, or know that my route is delayed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Acceptance Criteria - SMS Notifications</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Given I am a user<br>
When I purchase a ride, my ride is about to pick me up, or my ride is delayed<br>
Then I will receive an SMS for any of these</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="sprint-4-43---417"><a href="#sprint4">Sprint 4</a> (4/3 - 4/17)</h1>
<p>Sprint 4 was timeboxed from April 3rd through April 17th, 2019. This sprint was almost entirely concerned with concerns surrounding the teams’ implementation of MySQL into the application. The spectre of technical debt began to rear its’ head in this sprint most strongly when compared to the other sprints throughout the semester.</p>
<p>As such, sprint 4 was largely concerned with reconciling and overcoming the technical debt the team faced.</p>
<h1 id="sprint-5417---51"><a href="#sprint5">Sprint 5</a>(4/17 - 5/1)</h1>
<p>Sprint 5 was timeboxed from April 17th through May 1st. This sprint focused almost exclusively on refinement of existing features, <strong>unit testing</strong>, and also consisted of several Azure deployments to ensure that any work done during this sprint could be appropriately evaluated outside of a development environment. This sprint was largely concerned with bringing the product into a release or (at the very least) a demonstratable state, as shown on the 1st of May, 2019 for the project sponsors.</p>
<p>This sprint without a doubt marked the most rapid overall improvement in the quality of the product, with several long-standing issues and forms of technical debt being resolved within these two weeks. These issues being the correct implementations of MySQL and the design of the product.</p>
<h1 id="user-guide-1"><a href="#userguide">User Guide</a></h1>
<p>This section will detail the use of the features present in the final state of the application developed by Team Spartan over the course of CIDM 4390 during the Spring 2019 semester. Screenshots are included and detailed for the purposes of both clarificiation and instruction.</p>
<p>The project is hosted at <a href="www.cidmteamspartan.com">cidmteamspartan.com</a>. The use of a custom domain was purely for educational purposes, though it is the view of the author that it also serves a (decidedly less important) aesthetic purpose as well, as the original URL <a href="www.cidm4390teamspartan15.azurewebsites.net">cidm4390teamspartan15.azurewebsites.net</a>, could be viewed as rather difficult to retain.</p>
<h1 id="homepage">Homepage</h1>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/b0l6lpr.png" alt="The homepage"> The homepage of the application, with access to various features listed at the top along the navigation bar. These include a home button, a maps dropdown box, ridership proof of concept, payment proof of concept, with registration and login buttons on the far right.</p>
<h1 id="home-button">Home button</h1>
<p>The home button, as the name implies, simply returns the user to the homepage shown in the screenshot above if they had previously accessed any of the other features present on the site.</p>
<h1 id="maps">Maps</h1>
<p>Clicking on the map button at the top of the navbar displays a dropdown box from which one may select either a Canyon or Amarillo map, as shown in the image below.<br>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/kZbzYqX.png" alt="Maps dropdown"></p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/qpuqPbi.png" alt="Amarillo Map"><br>
The Amarillo map, viewable by selecting the “Amarillo” option from the dropdown box as shown in the above screenshot.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/rcevnCP.png" alt="Canyon map"><br>
The Canyon map, viewable by selecting the “Canyon” option from the dropdown box as shown in the above screenshot.</p>
<h1 id="check-in-ridership">Check In (Ridership)</h1>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/b0l6lpr.png" alt="Ridership"> This feature, which is intended to simulate the swiping of a bus pass to allow patrons to pay for bus rides without the need to physically pay for the ride at the point of service, can be accessed by clicking the “Check in (ridership)” button found in the navigation bar, to the right of the map button.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/s7MVN8i.png" alt="Ridership -- no data"> This page allows the user to enter in some arbitrary number as an ID into the box on the left, click the “swipe card” button, and the entered data is then used to generate:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/GzBs9nZ.png" alt="Ridership -- data"> A proof of concept for allowing the PRPC to provide what amounts to a ride history for patrons of public transportation in the area. Ideally this would provide these patrons with a list of all previous rides, their routes, a date and time stamp and some form of payment history as well.</p>
<h1 id="payment">Payment</h1>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/b0l6lpr.png" alt="Payment"> The payment proof of concept can be accessed from the “Payment” button to the right of the “check in (ridership)” button. Clicking on this button displays the following:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/24twL65.png%5C" alt="Stripe Concept"> A dialog box into which a prospective patron would enter the card information with which they wanted to pay for any rides they wished to take.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/7iwaLcr.png" alt="Payment done"> Hitting the “Swipe card” button in the previous image displays a “Payment Received!” message, meant to simulate the receipt of funds through the 3rd-party payment processor Stripe.</p>
<h1 id="registration">Registration</h1>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/b0l6lpr.png" alt="Registration"> If a user wished to register for the site, they would do so by clicking on the “Register” button found on the far right of the navigation bar in the screenshot above. Doing so displays:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/MKVAIaX.png" alt="Registration page"> A page in which they can enter in required information, as shown in the following image:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/V2VKNNY.png" alt="Account information entered"> Once the user clicks the “Register” button found at the bottom of the page, an email verification message is displayed, like so:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/q4WOiJD.png" alt="Email verification message"> Asking the user in question to confirm their email address via the address entered in the previous form.<br>
The email in question:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/AtZrmAH.png" alt="Gmail verification"> Click on the hyperlink (the blue “click here” link) redirects to the following screen:<br>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/D5uQSZF.png" alt="Email confirmed"> Informing the user that their email has been successfully verified, and their account created.</p>
<h1 id="login">Login</h1>
<p>If an existing user wished to login into the application after having already successfully created and verified an account previously, they would do so by clicking the “login” button found on the far right of the navigation bar found on the homepage, as shown the screenshot below:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/b0l6lpr.png" alt="Login"><br>
Clicking on this button directs the user to the following page:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/1VFm3is.png" alt="login page"> Wherein the user may enter their account credentials, like so:</p>

<h1 id="deployment-to-azure"><a href="#azure">Deployment to Azure</a></h1>
<p>The fruits of ones’ labor oftentimes wither in isolation, and this course has been no different. It would be unrealistic to expect to be able to evaluate progress and team velocity solely in a development environment. To that end, it was necessary (and expected) that we deploy the codebase so that it could be properly evaluated. The tool of choice was Microsofts’ Platform-as-a-service Azure. Deployment via Azure is detailed below, much in the same fashion as the User Guide section above, replete with both screenshots and explanations for clarification:</p>
<p>Deployment via Azure was achieved via two separate methods: via both local Git repositories and via BitBucket integration. Both are detailed herein:</p>
<p>In the image below is the the homepage for <a href="portal.azure.com">Azure</a><img src="https://i.imgur.com/etzAnal.png" alt=""> with a dizzying array of options in the left-hand panel and currently running instances of services displayed in the center of the screen under the heading “Recent resources”.</p>
<p>The instance with which we must concern ourselves however, is “CIDM4390TeamSpartan15”, whose details are displayed in the next image:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/UfJLLcD.png" alt="Azure 15 spartan"> Here, one can see a relevant overview for the deployment that ultimately became the final product for the teams’ efforts. Again, with a dizzying array of both options and information at ones’ disposal.</p>
<p>These are what might be called overviews however, and fail to capture the intricacies involved in Azure-based deployments. The next image attempts to recify this:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/2nVWKCy.png" alt="az console"></p>
<p>The console displayed at the bottom of the screen in the image of above is the beating heart of deployment via Azure; without it deployment would be decidedly impossible. Using said console, one (more or less) “tells” Azure how one wishes to deploy, and Azure generates an appropriate .git repository URL.</p>
<p>This URL is then configured as a remote source control repository in the development environment of ones choice.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/7fOK5M1.png" alt="deploy screen"></p>
<p>Once this is configured correctly, one must push the codebase in question to the aforementioned remote repository, and barring unforeseen complications, the codebase in question should be reachable on the internet.</p>
